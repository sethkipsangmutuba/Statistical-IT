 Introduction to IT and Computers Information Technology (IT) is the use of computers, networks, storage, and other digital systems to create, process, store, and exchange information. Computers are electronic devices that perform operations on data according to set instructions.Key concepts:Data vs. Information: Data are raw facts; information is processed data that has meaning.Types of Computers: Includes supercomputers, mainframes, personal computers (desktops, laptops), tablets, and smartphones.Basic Computer Functions: Input (receiving data), processing (working with data), output (displaying results), and storage (saving data for future use).IT in Everyday Life: Used in banking, education, healthcare, communication, business, and more.2. Fundamentals of Computer OperationsA computer performs several fundamental operations to function efficiently:Input: Accepting data from devices such as keyboards, mice, scanners.Processing: Manipulating input data using the CPU (Central Processing Unit).Output: Sending processed data to output devices like monitors, printers, and speakers.Storage: Saving data on storage media (hard drives, SSDs, optical discs).Control Unit: Manages and coordinates all other operations within the computer.Other important principles:Booting: The process of starting the computer and loading the operating system.Programming: Using instructions (software) to direct computer operations.3. Computer Hardware BasicsComputer hardware refers to the physical components that make up a computer system:Central Processing Unit (CPU): The "brain" that processes instructions.Memory: Includes RAM (temporary, fast storage for running programs) and ROM (permanent storage for firmware).Input Devices: Keyboards, mice, scanners, microphones.Output Devices: Monitors, printers, speakers.Storage Devices: Hard drives, SSDs, USB drives, CDs/DVDs.Motherboard: Main circuit board connecting all components.Peripheral Devices: External devices like printers, external hard drives, USB input devices.4. Computer Software BasicsSoftware is the set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. It can be categorized as:System Software: Controls basic functions. Includes the operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux), device drivers, and utility programs.Application Software: Designed to carry out specific tasks, such as word processing (MS Word), spreadsheets (Excel), browsers (Chrome), games, etc.Programming Software: Tools to create new software, like compilers, IDEs, and debuggers.Firmware: Specialized software embedded in hardware devices.5. Data and Data FilesData refers to raw facts and figures, while data files are organized collections of related data stored electronically.Types of data:Numeric, textual, audio, video, image.Structured (in databases, spreadsheets) vs. unstructured (emails, videos, social media content).Data files:Types: Text files (.txt), spreadsheets (.xls, .csv), databases (.mdb), images (.jpg, .png).File Extensions: Indicate the type of data and which applications can open them.File Organization: Flat files, hierarchical files, relational databases.6. Disk Storage FundamentalsDisk storage is a form of non-volatile storage where data is saved when the computer powers off.Types of disk storage:Hard Disk Drives (HDD): Magnetic disks with spinning platters.Solid-State Drives (SSD): Faster, no moving parts, stores data on flash memory.Optical Disks: CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs, read by lasers.USB Flash Drives: Portable, use flash memory.Key concepts:Storage Capacity: Measured in bytes (KB, MB, GB, TB).File System: Method used to organize and manage files (e.g., NTFS, FAT32).Reading/Writing: Disks store files in sectors and tracks, with read/write heads (in HDDs) or chips (in SSDs).
