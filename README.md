IT IN STATISTICS 
Computer - is an electronic device that process data, converting into information that is useful to people 
Examples of computers 
Desktop computer 
Workstation 
Notebook computers 
Tablet computer 
Smart phones
Handheld computers
Types of computers 
Personal computer - small scale epidemiological analysis, individual portfolio modelling 
Workstation 
Minicomputers -
Supercomputer 
Mainframe computer 

IT- use of computer , software, network and electric system to store ,process transmit and retrieve information 

Fundamentals of computer operations 
1.Input- process of entering data or instructions into the computer 
Input devices included : keyboard, microphone,mouse, scanner 
2.Processing  this is where the computer manipulates and transform data to process meaningful information using Central processing unit
Importance of CPU architecture 
a)ALU- handle numerical and logical operations 
b)CU- orchestrates tasks, fetching and decoding instructions 
c) Registers -functions include
‌they hold data in the CPU which prevents it from being lost
‌they offer temporal storage of data
‌enable transfer of data from one point to another 

3.Output devices which include the monitor,printer,speakers and projector 
4.Storage 
Primary storage
RAM- temporary storage for active programs 
ROM permanent memory that stores essential instruments 
Secondary storage
Hard disk,SSD,flash disk, memory card,CD/DVD 
Role of operating system 
Managing hardware 
Running applications 
Handling files
Allocating memory
Co-ordinating input and output 
Ensuring security 

COMPUTER HARDWARE BASICS
It refers to physical parts of a computer system that you can see and touch 
Input devices-used to enter data and instructions to the computer they include: keyboard,mouse, scanner, microphone,webcam, joystick.
Output devices -display or produce results from the computer they include: monitor,printers, projector, speaker 
Processing devices -it is the manipulation of data to produce Information.It is mainly done by the CPU
Storage devices 
‌ Primary storage - RAM- temporary storage for active programs 
-ROM- permanent memory that stores essential instructions 
Secondary storage - hard disk,SSD,flash disk, memory card, CD/DVD
Communication device 
Enable data transfer between computers they include modern, network interface card,WiFi adapter 
Internal components of a computer 
Motherboard - connects all components and allows communication between them
CPU-process and manipulate data to process information 
RAM-stores data and instructions temporarily 
Power supply unit-supplies electrical power to the computer 
Hard disk drice- uses magnetic platter to store data permanently 
Cooling system - prevents overheating by cooling 
         COMPUTER SOFTWARE BASICS 
It refers to the program instructions and data unit that tell a computer what to do
‌microsoft excel- a spreadsheet program used to enter, organise,analyse and calculate data using columns and formulas
‌microsoft access- database management system used to store , organise retrieve and manage data 
‌python- is a high level general purpose programming language 
          Python libraries include: numpy,pandas matplotlib, seaborne and plotly 
1.Numpy-used for numerical computing.It is imported as np 
2.Pandas-used for data manipulation and analysis.It is imported as pd
3.matplotlib-is the foundation of data visualization in python.It is imported ply
4.seaborn-is a python data visualization library built on top of matplotlib designed to make plot more attractive and easier to create .It is imported as sns
5.plotly-is a library for creating interactive and visually appealing plots.It is imported as px


DATA AND DATA FILES
Data- raw facts and figures that have not yet been processed 
Data files-are digital container used to store structures for future processing 
Information -is processed data that is meaningful and useful 
Types of data files
1 text files
2.binary files 
3.documeny files
4.spreadsheet files
5.database files
Advantage of data and data files in statics
1.easy storage and organisation 
2.fast retrieval
3.easy sharing and transfer
4.improved accuracy 
Limitation of data and data files
Corruption risk
Risk of loss 
Version control problems
Compatibility issues 

DISK STORAGE FUNDAMENTALS 
Secondary storage devices that permanently stored datastorage devices that permanently stored data
Storage measurements 
Bit-0 or 1 
Bytes- 8 bits
Kilobytes-1024bytes
Megabytes-1024KB
Gigabyte -1024MB
Terabytes -1024GB
Importance - storage drives determine data access speed ,realibility and system performance 
Applications - used in backup system cloud storage database , enterprise serves multimedia libraries and personal computer.
