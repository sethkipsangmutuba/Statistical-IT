Meaning of IT

Information Technology (IT) refers to the use of computers, networks, software, and other electronic systems to store, process, transmit, and retrieve information.

Meaning of a Computer

A computer is an electronic device that accepts data, processes it according to instructions, and produces meaningful output (information).

Characteristics of a Computer

Speed – Performs tasks quickly.

Accuracy – Produces correct results.

Storage – Stores huge amounts of data.

Automation – Works automatically after instructions.

Versatility – Can do different tasks.


Components of a Computer System

Hardware – Physical parts (keyboard, CPU).

Software – Programs and instructions.

Peopleware – Users who operate computers.

Data – Raw facts for processing.

2. Fundamentals of Computer Operations

Basic Operations

1. Input – Entering data (keyboard, mouse).


2. Processing – CPU works on data.


3. Output – Results displayed (monitor, printer).


4. Storage – Saving data for future use.


5. Control – Coordinates all operations.



Booting

The process of starting a computer.

Two types:

Cold booting: Starting from off.

Warm booting: Restarting when already on.



Computer Processing Cycle

Data → Process → Information → Storage
